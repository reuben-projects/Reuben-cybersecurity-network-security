#  Project 1: Basic Network Setup

This project demonstrates how to build a simple network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It includes configuring two PCs and a switch to ensure they can communicate with each other.

---

## 📝 Objective

- Set up a basic LAN with two computers and one switch.
- Assign static IP addresses.
- Test connectivity using the ping command.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Command Prompt (for ping testing)

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Drag and drop two PCs and one switch onto the workspace.
3. Connect the PCs to the switch using Copper Straight-Through cables.
4. Assign IP addresses:
   - PC1: `192.168.1.1/24`
   - PC2: `192.168.1.2/24`
5. Use the **Command Prompt** on each PC to test connectivity:
   - `ping 192.168.1.2` from PC1
   - `ping 192.168.1.1` from PC2
